**Project Title:** Exoplanet Detection Workshop for High School Students
<br/>
**Student:** 21067735, Iwan Stevens
<br/>
**Supervisor:** Dr Chris North
<br/> <br/> 
**Aims:** 
<br/> 
Create a workshop using streamlit.io for A-level physics students diving into exoplanet detection and the characterisation of their atmospheres, using the latest research.  

**Objectives:**
<br/> 
Research into exoplanet detection and characterisation. 
Look into WJEC A-level physics material to gain insight into the level of understanding that the material should be aimed at.
Gain proficiency using streamlit.io to create interactive web interfaces for use by the students.
Design a lesson plan that A-level students could understand looking into exoplanet detection and characterisation. 
Create an interactive streamlit.io page for use by the A-level physics students, teaching them about exoplanet detection and atmospheric characterisation.

**Brief Description:**
<br/>
One of the most popular areas of astronomy is the detection and characterisation of
exoplanets. It regularly features on high school curricula, though rarely uses up-to-date
data or details.
In this project you will design an interactive workshop or activity that can be completed by
school students to study the detection and characterisation of exoplanets. This will use
the streamlit.io interface, which provides a web interface to python scripts (similar to
Jupyter notebooks, but with the code hidden). It will use real data from exoplanets to
allow students to explore the factors that affect exoplanet detection, right from the basics
and up to the characterisation of atmospheres.
The work will be focussed on developing the workshop, and not delivering it in
classrooms. It will involve developing an understanding of exoplanet detection and
characterisation, how they might apply to an educational setting, and development of
hands-on activities and interactive tools in python with associated student and
teacher/facilitator guidance. The goal is that the developed activity will form part of an
ongoing engagement activity run by the Cardiff Hub for Astrophysics Research and
Technology (CHART).
